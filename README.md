# Wedding Website
A beautiful, feature rich, device friendly wedding website for my cousin.  
For a month, I had this deployed on Hostinger's server [kishorewedsmanasa.online](http://kishorewedsmanasa.online) . (May/2022).

# Highlights
1. Slick and fully __responsive__ design.
2. __Google Map__ showing your venue's location.
3. Countdown to start the event.
4. Tracks the site visitors count.

# Getting Started
1. `$ cd wedding-website` - go inside the project directory
2. `$ npm install` - install dependencies _(optional)_
3. `$ gulp` - compile sass to css, minify js, etc. _(optional)_
4. That's it, open `index.html` on your browser by just double-clicking on the file.
